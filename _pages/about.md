About me
======
I am serving as a Associate Research Fellow at the [SChool of Mathematics, Harbin Institute of Technology](https://math.hit.edu.cn/) I obtained my Ph.D from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/Default/index) and the [Institute of Natural Sciences (INS)](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), hosted by [Prof. Xiaoqun Zhang](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xqzhang/index.html). My current interests lie in applying and devising optimization algorithms (not limit to continuous optimization) for Medical Image Processing, Biomedical Engineering, and Proton Radiation Therapy.
