Many problem in data and imaging sciences can be formulated as a composite optimization problem,e.g., graphical lasso, CT reconstruction, etc. 
First-order primal dual methods are the classical methods to solve this class of problems. The talk is devoted to discussing three extensions of the primal dual fixed point (PDFP): the inertial PDFP (iPDFP), stochastic PDFP (SPDFP),
and stocahstic variance reduced PDFP (SVRG-PDFP)  to improve the optimization efficency for the medium and large scale size data and medical imaging problems. 
We rigorously give the convergence  analsis of the methods and carried out experiments to validate the correctness and effectiveness of the methods.
