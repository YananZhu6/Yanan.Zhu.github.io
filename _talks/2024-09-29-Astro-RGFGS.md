Rapid IMPT delivery is crucial for increasing proton therapy efficiency, treating more patients, improving dynamic target motion management, and enhancing treatment quality by minimizing uncertainties. It also allows for more breath-hold treatments with reduced normal tissue damage by minimizing target margins. This work reduces energy switching time, which directly affects IMPT delivery time, without sacrificing plan quality by using a novel Ridge-Filter-based and Group-Sparsity-regularized (RFGS) method, significantly decreasing the number of energy layers needed.
