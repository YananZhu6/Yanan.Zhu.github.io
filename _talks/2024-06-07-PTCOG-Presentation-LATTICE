LATTICE therapy is a three-dimensional spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT) technique that delivers a spatially modulated dose distribution
characterized by high-dose peaks and low-dose valleys within the target volume. When integrated with intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT), LATTICE therapy
benefits from the superior dose conformality of proton Bragg peaks, enabling more precise dose sculpting. However, the clinical implementation of LATTICE therapy
using IMPT has been limited by challenges such as suboptimal target coverage and increased dose deposition in adjacent organs-at-risk (OARs). This study introduces 
a novel proton arc therapy approach to enhance dose coverage while improving OAR sparing, thereby optimizing the delivery of Proton LATTICE therapy.
