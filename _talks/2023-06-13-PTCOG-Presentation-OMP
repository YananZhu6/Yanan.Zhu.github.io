The intensities (i.e., number of protons in monitor unit [MU]) of deliverable proton spots need to be either zero or meet a minimum-MU (MMU) threshold, which is a nonconvex problem. Since the dose rate is proportionally associated with the MMU threshold, higher-dose-rate proton radiation therapy (RT) (e.g., efficient intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) and ARC proton therapy, 
and high-dose-rate-induced FLASH effect needs to solve the MMU problem with larger MMU threshold, which however makes the nonconvex problem more difficult to solve.This work will develop a more effective optimization method based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for solving the MMU problem with large MMU thresholds, compared to state-of-the-art methods,
such as alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), proximal gradient descent method (PGD), or stochastic coordinate descent method (SCD).
