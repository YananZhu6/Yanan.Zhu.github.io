This work introduces an **Accelerated Primal-Dual Fixed Point (APDFP)** method, which leverages *Nesterov's acceleration technique* to solve composite optimization problems where a nonsmooth term is composed with a matrix.  

The **APDFP method** features fully decoupled iterations and can be regarded as a generalization of **Nesterovâ€™s second method** to settings where the linear operator in the objective is not the identity matrix.  

From a theoretical perspective, we improve the convergence rate of the *partial primal-dual gap* with respect to the Lipschitz constant from  

\[
\mathcal{O}\!\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) \quad \text{to} \quad \mathcal{O}\!\left(\frac{1}{k^2}\right).
\]  

Numerical experiments on **graph-guided logistic regression** and **CT image reconstruction** are conducted to validate the correctness and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.
