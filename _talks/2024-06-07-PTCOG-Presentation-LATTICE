LATTICE therapy is a 3D spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT) technique that delivers a spatially modulated dose pattern, with peaks and valleys, to the target area. Combining LATTICE with intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) can enhance dose conformality, as the proton Bragg peaks enable more precise dose delivery. However, challenges such as limited target coverage and increased exposure to 
nearby organs have constrained its application. This study presents a new approach using proton arc therapy to improve both target coverage and protection of organs-at-risk (OARs), aiming to advance Proton LATTICE therapy for broader clinical use.
