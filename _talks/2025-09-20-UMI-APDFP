This work proposes an **Accelerated Primal–Dual Fixed-Point (APDFP)** method that employs *Nesterov-type acceleration* to solve composite problems of the form  $$\min_x\, f(x) + g \circ B(x),$$  
where $g$ is nonsmooth and $B$ is a linear operator. The APDFP features fully decoupled iterations and can be regarded as a generalization of Nesterov’s accelerated gradient to the setting where $B$ can be a non-identity matrix.  
**Theoretical contribution.** We improve the convergence rate of the partial primal-dual gap with respect to the Lipschitz constant of $\nabla f$ from  $$\mathcal{O}\!\left(\tfrac{1}{k}\right)$$  to  $$\mathcal{O}\!\left(\tfrac{1}{k^2}\right).$$  
**Numerical experiments.** We validate the correctness and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method through experiments on **graph-guided logistic regression** and **CT image reconstruction**.
