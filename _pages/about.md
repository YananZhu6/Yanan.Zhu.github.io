About Me
======
I am a postdoctral researcher in the [University of Kansas Medical Center](https://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/academics/departments/radiation-oncology/research/gao-lab-x19611.html). I obtained my PHD from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/Default/index) and the [Institute of Natural Sciences(INS)](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), hosted by [Prof. Xiaoqun Zhang](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xqzhang/index.html). My current interests lie in applying and devising optimization algorithms (not limit to mathematical programming) for Medical Image Processing, Biomedical Engineering and Proton Radiation Therapy.
