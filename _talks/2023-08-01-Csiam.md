Many problems in data and imaging sciences can be formulated as composite optimization problems, such as graphical lasso, CT reconstruction, and more. Classical approaches for solving this class of problems often involve first-order primal-dual methods. This talk will focus on three extensions of the primal-dual fixed point (PDFP) algorithm: the inertial PDFP (iPDFP), stochastic PDFP (SPDFP), and stochastic variance-reduced PDFP (SVRG-PDFP). These enhancements are designed to improve optimization efficiency, especially for medium- and large-scale datasets and medical imaging applications. We rigorously present the convergence analysis for each method and conduct experiments to demonstrate their correctness and effectiveness.
