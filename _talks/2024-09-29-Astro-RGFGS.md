Rapid IMPT delivery is essential for improving proton therapy efficiency, allowing more patients to be treated, enhancing dynamic target motion management, and reducing uncertainties to improve treatment quality. It also enables more breath-hold treatments while minimizing normal tissue damage by reducing target margins.
This work focuses on reducing energy switching time—a key factor in IMPT delivery speed—without compromising plan quality. By introducing a novel Ridge-Filter-based and Group-Sparsity-regularized (RFGS) method, we significantly decrease the number of required energy layers, making treatment faster and more efficient.
